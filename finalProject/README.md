Karson Chilcott and I (Spencer Schultz) would like to create a small web app in which one can save a link (naming it as whatever they would like) to a site they enjoy or need for whatever reasons, and tag it with something (such as "work", or "Japanese", "fun time"). The app will have some automatic organization based on the tags given, but will also allow the user reorganize it as they see fit. The user can add more links, delete old links, and update links. For now, we will restrict the number of tags to 5, but in the future take off the limit. This is the basic form, and as for stretch goals the links could also gather some heuristics and present them back to the user (such as times clicked, most recent, links clicked "together", etc.) which could also be used to reorganize the links as well. Another stretch goal could be to embed images or something representative of the link (somewhat like how the "new tab" works in Google for commonly visited sites). Further more, this could end up being scaled as we could have users log in and each have their own page from anywhere, but that would be farther in the future.
