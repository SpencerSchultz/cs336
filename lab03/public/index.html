				<li> A) Node.js is a tool used to help build web applications with a heavy I/O base,
while Express.js is a framework that is built on top of Node that essentailly
makes Node easier to work with.</li>
				<li> B) The package.json file contains data about the program, as well as what
dependencies there are within the program.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> 3.2
				<ul>
				<li> A) These files are static because once they are loaded they should not be changed.
</li>
				<li> B) The server does continue to server up the Hello World message when there user
is at the root path, and has not specified a directory. This is because in the js file
we are calling a get on the root and sending the Hello World message there.</li>
